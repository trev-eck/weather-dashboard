# Weather Dashboard

The goal of this project was to create a responsive single-page website that uses a 3rd-party weather API to dynamically render current weather data as well as a 5-day forecast on to the screen. The user is able to search for a city to display the weather, this search term is saved to local storage and added to the page in case they would like to check it again.
